        <h1>Maxwell's Favorite Films</h1>
            <h2>Some of my favorite movies</h2>
    <hr />
                <h3>Tombstone</h3>
                    <p>Incredible western I grew up with during my childhood. There was a time when I could quote the movie almost line for line, much to the detriment of those watching with me.
                    Though not as thorough as I once was, I stil have the highlights memorized.</p>
                <h3>The Saint</h3>
                    <p>1997 film based on the eponymous character initially created by Leslie Charteris in 1928. This was another film from my childhood.
                    Val Kilmer, my favorite actor, plays The Saint, an orphaned, unnamed thief whose aliases are all names of Catholic saints.</p>
                <h3>How to Steal a Million</h3>
                    <p>Classic movie starring Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole.
                    An art-forgers daughter must team up with an art thief to steal a forgery from a museum with her families honor at stake.</p>
                <h3>RocknRolla</h3>
                    <p>My introduction to Guy Ritchie's take on a London Crime drama. I'm still disappointed that the promised sequel never materialized.</p>
                <h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>
                    <p>The movie that made me fall in love with Wes Anderson's eccentric cinematography.</p>
